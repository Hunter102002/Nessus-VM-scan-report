# Vulnerability Assessment Using Nessus

## Objective

Conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) using Nessus, followed by the creation of a detailed vulnerability report prioritizing critical and high-severity issues.

### Skills Learned

- Vulnerability Scanning: Performing a thorough scan of the VM to identify security weaknesses using Nessus.
- Risk Assessment: Evaluating identified vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact.
- Reporting: Compiling a detailed vulnerability report with prioritized recommendations for remediation.
- Security Best Practices: Understanding common vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them

### Tools Used

- Nessus: For conducting the vulnerability assessment and identifying critical security flaws.
- Kali Linux: As the platform for deploying and managing the Nessus scan.
- Virtual Machine: A deliberately vulnerable VM used as the target for the assessment.

### Outcome
This project successfully demonstrated the process of identifying and assessing vulnerabilities in a target system using Nessus. The final report provided actionable insights, prioritizing critical and high-severity issues to guide remediation efforts. The project showcased skills in vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, and reporting within a cybersecurity context.
